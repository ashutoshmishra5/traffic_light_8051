# Traffic-Light using 8051 microprocessor

This project is developed using the C language and Keil compiler. It simulates an automatic traffic light system using the AT89C51 microprocessor. The project's schematic was designed using Proteus software, and it includes both C and assembly language codes. 

The system utilizes an LCD display to provide supplementary information about the current signal and three LED sequences to display traffic signals, simulating traffic lights changing at intervals of 5 seconds. The traffic light sequence, controlled by both C and assembly code, operates in a cycle with 5-second intervals between lights.
