This project is developed using the C language and Keil compiler. this project simulates an automatic traffic light system using the AT89C51 microprocessor.
The project's schematic was designed using Proteus software and both C and assembly language codes are included.
The system utilizes an LCD display to provide supplementry information about the current signal and three LED sequences to display traffic signal,
simulating traffic lights changing at intervals of 5 seconds. The traffic light sequence, controlled by both C and assembly code, operates in a cycle with 5-second
intervals between lights.
